# Introduction to s3gen

`s3gen` is a static site generator designed with the Go developer in mind. It eschews the trend of complex, monolithic frameworks in favor of a library-first approach that prioritizes developer control, flexibility, and simplicity.

## The Philosophy of s3gen

The core philosophy of `s3gen` is that a developer should have full control over their website's structure and build process. Instead of enforcing a rigid set of conventions, `s3gen` provides a powerful set of tools and a flexible, rule-based engine that you can use to build your site exactly the way you want.

This means you are not limited to just Markdown and basic templating. You can define your own rules to process any file format, from SASS to custom data formats, and integrate them seamlessly into your build process.

## Who is s3gen for?

`s3gen` is for Go developers who:

*   Want to build a static website without leaving the Go ecosystem.
*   Prefer a library-based approach over a large, opinionated framework.
*   Desire fine-grained control over their site's build process.
*   Need to extend their site's functionality with custom logic.
*   Want to embed their static site generation directly into a larger Go application.

If you enjoy building things from the ground up and want a tool that empowers you rather than restricting you, `s3gen` is the right choice for you.
