# S3Gen

S3Gen is a simple static site generator written in Go.  It lets you do some frequent things very easily:

1. Compile your posts and content written in markdown (.md) into html files to be served statically.
2. Use Go templating and a rich set of "builtin" functions for you to use.
3. Use custom templates for different pages in your website/blog.
4. Generates an RSS feed so your site can be consumed via a feed reader
5. Generates a sitemap useable by search engines
6. Library mode to programatically serve static sites inside another binary
